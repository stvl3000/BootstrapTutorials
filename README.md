# BootstrapTutorials
Just had a quick learning followed the Bootstrap's official site tutorials. It's pretty good and much easier than build JS animations from scratch. I think this collection of the sample code blocks should be a good reference for coding practice, especially when not only focus on creating frontend. However, they may not be all exactly same with the official samples, but the structures and views are same.
